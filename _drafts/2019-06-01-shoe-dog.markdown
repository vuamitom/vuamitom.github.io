Shoe Dogs are people whose life centered about their obsession with shoes. 

Once you pick this book up, it is really hard to put it down. Having read some autobiographies of business figures like Sam Walton or Michael Dell, I was skeptical at first. Would it be an account of accomplishments and successes, looked back from the presence and told with a sense of confidence and certainty, which is hard to relate to. On the contrary, the book's protagonists are a bunch 

Phil paints the picture of himself as someone who like war stories, love sports and running, risk takers and he seldom gives praises.  

This book is a rythm that flows through time. A never stopping cycle of borrowing, collect money from sales, repaying and then borrow again. Keeping the money float and liquidity is a single most important battle he find. Grow the company at a neck breaking pace and manage money circulation to keep creditors happy. 

It is not a pinky picture, there were losses, emotion and whatifs. 

And entrepreneurs who are broke most of the time.
