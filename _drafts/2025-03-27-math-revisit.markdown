Recently I have the time and motivation to give math another try.
Out of school, my day to day usage of math is mostly arithmetic. 
The common use has been to estimate algorithm complexity, which is straightforward in most cases, (until it is not. e.g the [coupon collector problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coupon_collector%27s_problem))

Math in the school has been mechanical in my experience, like how one trains ML models with supervised learning. 
Students are given bulk loads of problems and answers to solve until the problems themselves become familiar. 
That worked up to certain point. In fact, the math of college freshmen year in Singapore was very manageable since most questions are not so different from Vietnamese high school math. 

Yet can the subject be anything other than homework exercises just to get over with. 
Someone said that learning math is like learning a new language. To learn a language, one pickup the grammar and the vocabulary, word by word until the whole sentence starts to make sense.  

The vocabulary of math is the strange notations and symbols that can be daunting to look at. Probably due to thousand years of constant evolving, mathematics has a large body of knowledge that sometimes the math writer ignore that readers don't share it. 
Can it really be that, like a new language, once learnt, open yourself up to insights, meanings, novels and all sort of enjoyment? I consider it a personal project to test out the claim that math can be enjoyable even to layman. 

And probably I can become a cool dad once my kid reach school age. I can tell them one thing or two about mathematics that their teachers may not. 

I started off with the book Programmer introduction to mathematics. The author covers a large breadth of topics with suggested topics to look up even further. That can be overwhelming. 
I want to go for depth, not breadth. 
In a mathematician's lament, the author argues that, math problems should be approached slowly, a fruitful struggle that after the pain comes the sweetness. 
I 'm trying another book "Linear algebra done right" 



I don't remember when I first learnt about vectors. 
Maybe it was sometimes in sophomore years, when the Decart plane was introduced. 
A vector is a directed line between two points on the plane.

In linear algebra done right

- a vector space is a set of lists, functions or objects. 
- math operator like minus sign does not just exist, it is a notion we define. 
- vector space can be defined recursively. e.g Vs as a vector space over V, which is a vector space over F (either C or R)

This is an ongoing project. Learning a new language takes year.
