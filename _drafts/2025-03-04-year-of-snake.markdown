Us Asian are supertitious. 
Unpleasant events at the first few days of the lunar new year are often considered foresigns of a rocky year. 
Being scammed into wrongful parking and getting the car towed away check the box of an unpleasant event. 
And rocky it has been, only a month into the new year of Snake.

My employer, a health care startup, is winding down due to a hack that compromised users's data. 
The course of events spanned over two weeks. We were all in disbelief given how quick that happened. I know that the decision was not taken lightly. 
After the news sank in, we said well wishes and thanks to each other, appreciating the chance of working together. 
As a team, we moved with momentum. The product was good. Users loved it. The ARR curve was growing exponentially. 
If it was hard on me one, it must be ten times harder on other people who have devoted even more time and energy. 

The event, in Nassim Taleb's term, can be categorized as a Black Swan event, which was both unexpected and had a huge effect on our growing start up. A month ago, never did anyone of us think that closing down is a possibility. Insurance is a good way to mitigate such events. We did have Cyber insurance plan and that helped to certain extent. 

Rules and penalties to protect privacy can cripple small companies. 
Had the hack happened another year later, we would probably have survied. 

It does not matter who caused the vulnerability now and we all shared responsibility for not realizing the issue earlier. A lot of conventional wisdom has been about hiring great people, I 'm adding that it's equally important to just avoid hiring bad ones. Especially for startup, mistakes have large consequences. 
Everyone makes mistakes. An innocent mistake while giving reasonably sufficient attention to the job is no reason to label a person bad. But I am really pissed when the sole person who was responsibile for infrastructure were doing another full time job at the same time without us knowing it(due to the remote setting). Dividing one's attention by half can be the root of evils. 

I will write about the breach in another post.
