Memory managed languages often hide away the need for direct memory allocation. As a result, novice programmers often forget how costly memory allocation is. 

I encountered this piece of code from new Javascript programmers.
Example
```javascript
a.map()

a.forEach()
```
The intention is to run a job on every element of the original array and modify it in place. But having change

When concatenate list or array
Example

```
numpy.concatenate


java list addAll must call ensureCapacity
```
