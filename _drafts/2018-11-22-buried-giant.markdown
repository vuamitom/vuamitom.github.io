The book set its context in Britain's post Arthur era, a time of transition, when magic does not present itself in day to day life, but its influence lingers as a strange mist robbing people of their memory. Heros like Arthur, Merlin are so recent in people's talks yet begin to slip into folklores. Curses and bad luck are no longer credible. People start to distinguish between supertition and all. 

In that context, an old couple embark on a journey to their son's village. Like many people, they can't remember their past. The past only comes to them dream-like at moments of breaking dawn or provoked by familiar things/people. 

As the story progresses, the couple go from longing to reclaim their past to hesistance as dark memory surfaces. In the end, it turns out that forgetting is the only way to heal. Had they not forgotten, they would not have grown to love each other that much. 

The debate about action. Peace built on a buried past. Or should the past be unearthed and hatred continues. While hatred is forgetten, loving moments are as well.
