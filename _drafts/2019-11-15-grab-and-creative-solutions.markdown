Loyalty problem. No natural mole. 
Grab business 
Grab rewards

Amazon-like customer obsession. 
- Grab kitchen
- Grab stands at airport, hotels.

The rationale behind grab kitchen could have been: a product manager looking at distribution of wait time (delivery time) across demographic areas (districts) and see that delivery time for far flung districts are high (due to them order from center districts food). Whatif we can cut it down by moving restaurants nearer. And the article about how Uber eat enables delivery only restaurants. And that come into places nicely. 

Remember the Bono book on creativity. There is a section about thinking in a forward manner, creativity is fostered by suppress initial skepticism, inclination to see impossibility. The matter of simply changing a 'BUT' to an 'AND'. Let say we were thinking about: moving restaurants nearer to far flung places AND which requires lots of money.
