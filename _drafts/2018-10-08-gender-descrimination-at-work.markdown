Sometimes, even the best of intention can be riding people their chances and options. One of my male colleagues were scanning job seekers' CV. Among them was a female girl's application. These days, getting applications from female software engineers are still something does not happen regularly. At that time, our team was working late and over the weekends in many occassion. My male colleague outright rejected the applicant on the ground that she is a girl and the environment would be too taxing for a girl to bear. Adding that his habit of being loud and harsh would scare the girl off. It was good intention, to save someone the trouble of going to work just to find out that it is too tough. But there are a lot of things wrong about that.

 behind that good intention is streotyping that a girl is week and incapable of enduring stressful environment. Rejecting someone on the ground that the demanding of work is not what she is willing to give is different from rejecting simply because of she being a girl. A gril can be resilient. A girl can be accepting. Manytime more than boys.

 secondly, Stressful environment is harmful for everyone, why not judge that it is our fault and try to provide a better times, instead of looking for male workers who are supposed to be loistering late into the night and over the weekend. What happen if someone is male and yet not willing to go with the flow? Why should it be assumed that.
