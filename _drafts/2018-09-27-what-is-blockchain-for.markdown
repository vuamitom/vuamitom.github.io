Major characteristics of a blockchain
- distributed
- open and immutability
- concensus at the absense of trust (PoW)


Blockchain is more like a solution seeking a problem.
First I'm going to rebuke some of the myth of using blockchain
- case A: is block chain really necessary? (freight tracking,...)
- case B: why blockchain is necessary here? ethermon, cryptokittens? 
- case C:....

I think the value of blockchain would most likely comes from cost saving. Benefactors would be associations, gov orgs, where db need to open to outsiders. Single source of truth, avoid the need to replicate data between organization. (give a before vs after example here). No need to design an API ( the old way,) but the ledger  protocol is already popular. ==> cost saving in terms of development and information cost (dont have to training, communicating api )

Secondly, it is distributed. If done right, it will shows other app how to handle authentication/auth in a distributed setting. Say about POS application. Application which is offline first. You add node later on when you need it. there is no server in between.
