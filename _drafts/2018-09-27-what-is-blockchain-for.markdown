First I need to decide whether I talk about blockchain only or blockchain and cryptocurrencies.

Generally speaking, blockchain can be thought of as an ledger which, technically, can be viewed by anyone. This one-liner summarization can risk oversimplifying blockchain's value and thus riding its of it merit. But it is no small feat to be open and at the same time functional and resilient against frauds, technical hiccups and human faults. If I was to setup my own online ledger with its database, and open it in service of the world, it would probably go down in seconds (assuming that it got people attention). Hackers would try to shoot it down. Overly active tinkerers would randomly credit their accounts with imaginary amount. 

Blockchain solved the first problem by being distributed. The blockchain data replicates itself on thousands of computer carrying it, let's call it blockchain nodes. Now, if hackers attacked my blockchain node and wiped it out entirely, nobody would lose access to the blockchain data as there are backups all over places. Except for the trouble of having to setuping up my node over again, I would not loose much. 

Secondly, credit one's balance on the blockchain is not like flipping a few bits in the database. You can't pull a token out of thinair. In order to obtain a token, a unit of currency in blockchain, computer needs to solve cryptographically hard equation. Each token is a number that statisfies the cryptographical condition set out in blockchain's protocol, and thus, a token is uniquely identitifed by this number. This uniqueness allows the token to exist not simply as a series of byte copyable in an instant, but rather a thing with history that can be tracked from when it was first computed to where it belongs to now. It's like a bank note with serial number. 

And back to being distributed. Being distributed solves one problem while create another. If both of you and me owns a copy of the ledger, and they differ. How can we determine which one is the honest one. Here proof of work comes into play. PoW dictates that the longer your chain is, the more trustworthy your blockchain is. Why? Because it takes time to create a new block. If the culprit does not have enough computing power to overtake honest majority, he won't be able to fake it. If he does, it would make more sense for him to just create his own blockchain.

So with the ability to solve double-spending problem, and operate without an immediatories (absense of trust), blockchain is overhyped with promises. But largely it's still a solution waiting for a (practical) problem. Blockchain usage has been mostly about its monetary value. And applications in this area centers about creating an ecosystem that support this new currency. 

Blockchain is currently used mostly as backing of crypto currencies. What of crypto currencies? It has advantages blockchain have to offer. And some cases we feel like only crypto currencies is a solution. Like a token to incentivize services (bittorrent with TRON, telegram, kambria,...). What would happen if we don't use blockchain. Technically, distributed service at heart like bittorrent would need to invent similar infrastructure. Thus blockchain is the missing piece. If it was to invent it all in a centralized fashion, would hinder the usefulness and transferrability of the new token. End some other micropayment (like in IoT renting). Just imagine the alternative. Like having a server recording all transaction (no real money move, just flip of byte and bit in database). The resulting action would be to have interface, and transfer money behind the scene via bank accounts. (It would not create a vibrant ecosystem). In this sense, "open" ledger leads to exchangability and spendability of money token. We can draw a comparision from traditional loyaty program (points). It is not a must. But more elegant a solution.

Blockchain promises to display financial incumbents. But transferring money between parties are not the only thing they do.

Blockchain is a database. however, it does not store all the data. Most current application is hybrid. And use blockchain for only the critical part that they don't want to lose, or want ot open it, or want it to be stable. However, since not all data is there, there is still posibility that the off-chain data is fake, tampered with. It's like the bank now, when nobody bothers to mess with the database, they mess with the procedures outside it.

Blockchain promises to display government. yet self-governing is not easy. There scam, fraud. Can it protect from ourselves. For example. Bitcoin Cash was created, deprecitated value of the bitcoin. (Same as government printing money) 

So even in this aspect, blockchain present a solution that is more elegant and cost-saving. It's a common figment of imagination that everybody believes in. You don't have to sit people from ten banks in a room to make them agree on a common database format or application api. They are already sold. But let's not think of 

The blockchain ledger would go down only if all of the thousands of machines hosting it went down.  
- distributed
- open and immutability
- concensus at the absense of trust (PoW)

All of that 

Blockchain is more like a solution seeking a problem.
First I'm going to rebuke some of the myth of using blockchain
- case A: is block chain really necessary? (freight tracking,...)
- case B: why blockchain is necessary here? ethermon, cryptokittens? 
- case C:....

Yuval Noah write in Sapiens that things in life like comppanies, organizations, money, economy was created/conceived by human's common narrative, or a "figment of human imagination". Crypto currencies embody that more than anything else. One day a man named Satoshi published a paper, and the next day, sequence of bits in computer take on value. It does not cease to exist. It does not lose value (for that to happen, everyone on earth need to stop believeing in it. Or they should have a larger, newer narrative to believe in)

We are creating crypto currencies to protect ourselves from evil government, ineffictive intermediatries. But what if we are enemies of ourselves. What if the do-gooders turn into incumbents. They still have a monopoly over information. That is why fraud and scam happens. 


I think the value of blockchain would most likely comes from cost saving. Benefactors would be associations, gov orgs, where db need to open to outsiders. Single source of truth, avoid the need to replicate data between organization. (give a before vs after example here). No need to design an API ( the old way,) but the ledger  protocol is already popular. ==> cost saving in terms of development and information cost (dont have to training, communicating api )

Secondly, it is distributed. If done right, it will shows other app how to handle authentication/auth in a distributed setting. Say about POS application. Application which is offline first. You add node later on when you need it. there is no server in between. 


Is cryptocoin a currency or an asset. 

if it is a currency, its value is backed by trust, which is similar to fiat money. Except that monetary tool is not workable for them. And currency with this much fluctuation is not a good thing.

Or is it an investment asset. Yes it is most likely an investment asset. 

Look we already own digital money since the prevailance of internet and mobile banking. The different is that it's not limited to an organization. Crypto assets are still managed by an organization (storage may be distributed), but the creation/management of money as a platform is separated from the use of money for commercial/credit need. It can be shared. 

Blockchain application can be categorized as crypto currencies application and pratical applications. Crypto currency application was app born out of the need for a new ecosystem that supports that new technology, such as trading, wallet, market watch. It treats crypto currency as a foreground thing, the purpose and the end meet. Whereas other applications leverage blockchain and crypto currencies as a way to solve real world problem. The latter is more rare.
