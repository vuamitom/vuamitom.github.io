Major characteristics of a blockchain
- distributed
- open and immutability
- concensus at the absense of trust (PoW)


Blockchain is more like a solution seeking a problem.
First I'm going to rebuke some of the myth of using blockchain
- case A: is block chain really necessary? (freight tracking,...)
- case B: why blockchain is necessary here? ethermon, cryptokittens? 
- case C:....

I think the value of blockchain would most likely comes from cost saving. Benefactors would be associations, gov orgs, where db need to open to outsiders. Single source of truth, avoid the need to replicate data between organization. (give a before vs after example here). No need to design an API ( the old way,) but the ledger  protocol is already popular. ==> cost saving in terms of development and information cost (dont have to training, communicating api )

Secondly, it is distributed. If done right, it will shows other app how to handle authentication/auth in a distributed setting. Say about POS application. Application which is offline first. You add node later on when you need it. there is no server in between. 


Is cryptocoin a currency or an asset. 

if it is a currency, its value is backed by trust, which is similar to fiat money. Except that monetary tool is not workable for them. And currency with this much fluctuation is not a good thing.

Or is it an investment asset. Yes it is most likely an investment asset. 

Look we already own digital money since the prevailance of internet and mobile banking. The different is that it's not limited to an organization. Crypto assets are still managed by an organization (storage may be distributed), but the creation/management of money as a platform is separated from the use of money for commercial/credit need. It can be shared. 

Blockchain application can be categorized as crypto currencies application and pratical applications. Crypto currency application was app born out of the need for a new ecosystem that supports that new technology, such as trading, wallet, market watch. It treats crypto currency as a foreground thing, the purpose and the end meet. Whereas other applications leverage blockchain and crypto currencies as a way to solve real world problem. The latter is more rare.
