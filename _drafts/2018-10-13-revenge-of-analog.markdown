Holding this book in hand, flipping the paper, hear the rustling sound, move your finger across the rough texture of page, one get the most out of this book. And this is arguably how book should read, the tangible, rewarding way of holding a book in hand, tuning out of all the distraction that a digital medium carrying with itself. One get the satisfaction of finding comrades/kindreds, people who are truthful to our own physical nature. "Human are physical animals". We need to read/listen to music with all our senses. The book beautifully put in words this nagging feeling of incomplete we have taking another photos, automating another tasks, delivering another products?

Analog products' days were predicted by digital mavens to be numbered. Yet, just when all hope is thought to be lost, sales of books, vinyl records, film were going down hill, it stops. Like after adopting digitial alternatives, people realized the experience is not the same (or the end product, or they miss the original experiences with analog) and migrate back to analog. And even digital natives, who don't look for analog out of nostalgia like their parents, discover analog with eyes wide open and embrace the experience it brings. 

For one, analog products are all about experiences. The touch, the feel. We work with all our senses.

For second, analog is imperfect. And precisely this imperfection is emotional and creative. It does not have to be the same. It does not have to be safe, like digital copy. And it's not only the end product, but the process of making analog product is anolog as well. It creates the good randomness/messiness that is inducive to creative process. One story recounted when Beatle were recording their song. (quote here).

Thirdly, it imposes a good limitation. Like drawing on paper, you are constrained by the size of your page. The blank page is powerful yet not too daunting a task, it has limit in size, somewhere to start, some way to grasp its in its entirety. And you must lay down the seemingly unending thoughts and ideas into this squared blank space. The limitation of effort. If you paint it wrong, there is no going back/undo. Your only choice is to go with the flow. Be focus and give it your all.

Although the book sounds kinda repetitive towards the end, it's probably because the author wants to drive home a single point. The need to connect and to physically engaged in activities we do as human.
