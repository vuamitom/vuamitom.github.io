Some time you should n't be coding

Everybody shouldn't be coding. You do it only when it's absolutely necessary. Or you do it because you do it. It shouldn't be glorified culture. There is thing you could've done with Excel. No. Writing a piece of software that nobody uses is painful.

quote from gojek:
```
"We don’t have “office timings”. We’re not a 9-5 “job”. Everyone codes. Leaders are 24 years old or 50. Age doesn’t define leadership. If we’re not failing, we’re not doing it right. We have a cross-pollination of ideas from Singapore, Indonesia and India. And lastly, embrace chaos."
```

1. Stop theorizing 2. Write lots of software 3. Learn from your mistakes
