We learnt Double helix, DNA, RNA in high school. 
Yet why do we need to learn that. 
Without the motivation, those are another formual to remember. 
Natures are full of mechanisms that work in fascinating ways. 
Scientists learn about the human genomes not only by examining bacteria, the more ancient species. 
An anology: looking through microscope, you see different pieces of lego. And you put them into good use. 

Bacteria immune system has the mechanism to cut and paste a sequence of gene. 
For survival, they also has ability to copy a DNA strand. 
Had I known that RNA researches gave rise to biological tool such as 


Central Dogma: 

DNA -> transcribed into RNA --> Protein 

Below are some terms that I used to hear it as the same things, but are actually different. 
Genome is a collection of gene and non-coding sequences
There are four main bases (nucleiotides)
Gene is a specific sequence of bases that encode a protein. 
Chromosomes;
There are only about 20000 genes (1% of DNA)
The rest are non-coding sequences.
