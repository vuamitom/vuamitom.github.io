Feedforward network is approximating a unknown function f(x) using known unit functions. 

Any learning algorithms consist of these components: 
- a model
- a cost function
- an optimization procedure

Design choices


#### Output Units

Sigmoid function 
#### Hidden Units

ReLu Rectified linear unit
