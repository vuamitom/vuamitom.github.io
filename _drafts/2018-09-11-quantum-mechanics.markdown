Particles and fields are one. 

Light are undulations of electronmagnetic field as much as swarm of photons.

Other particles are as well quanta of a quantum field.

It bought about property
1.  Granualarity

Democritus: There are a limit to divisibility.
Eigenvalue equation: electron can not just take any velocity around a nucleus. It can only assume a finite number of velocities, momentums..., which is determined by eigenvalue equation. That is why we see spetral of light waves. Or electron only orbits at certain energy levels (???) 

2.	Indeterminecy.

The world is not a world of particles, but rather it's a succession of micro events.On macro level, a stone looks still. But at the smallest level, it's fluctuations.

We can't say for sure if a electron is going to the left. but only assign a probability to it. We don't know where and when it turns up, but how likely it will. 

Unlike Laplace demon, we can't determine future based on the state of the present. Because the world at it's core is probabilistic.  

3.	Relational.
