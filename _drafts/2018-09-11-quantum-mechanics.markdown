The book is a glorified account of how scientific thinking of people who are brave enough to embrace uncertantiy, humble enough to admit the limit of their own ignorance, to question what have always been the norm (faith of the crowd)

the book provides popular explanation about current understanding of reality, which should be combination of general relativity, quantum mechanics and thermal time. 

The book is not only a science book, but also a history book. Turning to the first few pages, reader was brought back to more than 2 millenials ago, where the scientists of antiquity contemplate about the nature of reality. Scientific thinking was once flourished before the Roman empire adopt Christainity as the empire's official religion and ends tolerance for polytheism. 

It was a moving piece. Thinker of antiquities without advances in mathametics, engineering, lack the equipments to experiment and observatory result. However, they still manage to reflect, question and propose a world view which is pretty close to mordern physics' explanation. It shows the power of intuition and vivid imagination. Thinkers like Democritus, Anexamandria, thought of the world as consisting of granualar atoms, which are the lower limit of divisibility of our physical world.


Particles and fields are one. 

Light are undulations of electronmagnetic field as much as swarm of photons.

Other particles are as well quanta of a quantum field.

It bought about property
1.  Granualarity

Democritus: There are a limit to divisibility.
Eigenvalue equation: electron can not just take any velocity around a nucleus. It can only assume a finite number of velocities, momentums..., which is determined by eigenvalue equation. That is why we see spetral of light waves. Or electron only orbits at certain energy levels (???) 

2.	Indeterminecy.

The world is not a world of particles, but rather it's a succession of micro events.On macro level, a stone looks still. But at the smallest level, it's fluctuations.

We can't say for sure if a electron is going to the left. but only assign a probability to it. We don't know where and when it turns up, but how likely it will. 

Unlike Laplace demon, we can't determine future based on the state of the present. Because the world at it's core is probabilistic.  

3.	Relational.

Particles acquire properties such as velocity, angular momentum only in relation to others ( at collision )

- relative speed
- time is relative. The simultaneoity is relative to the motion of an object with respect to other?
- up and down are relative???

There is no subjective reality. Eistein. 




It's also about how our daily notion of time and space must change. Space is no longer a container, time is nolonger the flow by which events unfold. But rather space is the gravitational field it self. time is another dimension of reality. Thinking about a spacetime foam. Space is the mesh in the surface, time is its height. Spacetime is a field, 

We don't really measure time. But measure something vs something else.
