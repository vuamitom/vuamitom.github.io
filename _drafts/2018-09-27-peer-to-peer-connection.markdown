Before ipv6, due to limit of number of ipv4, network segmented into public and private network. Public network are computers visible to any connected computers. Private network are computers behind gate keeper (NAT server, can be from ISP, corporate network), to which computers outside network can't initiate connection to. 

TCP/UDP connection is asymmetric in a sense that, only IP address of one party need to be known for 2-way communication to proceed. (Unlike email, if you want to reply, you have to get address of the initiator). 

How bittorrent client connect to peers which are not publicly available.
