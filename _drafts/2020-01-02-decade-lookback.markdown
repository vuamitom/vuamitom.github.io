A decade time would feel short when the clock was ticking pass midnight on the last day of 2019. Where all the time has gone. Yet, a simple act of comparison between the self now and a decade ago, that whole decade would start to appear more real, heavier and thicker in one's awareness. Old perceptions, preferences, fears, worries, desires were replaced by the new. Changes happened slow enough that one hardly noticed, yet, significant enough to surprise us when compressed in a moment of reminiscing. This is my first time to write them down.

Career wise, I earned my bachelor degree, got my first job and worked in 5 different cities. A few things that I used to do when I first started to work but no longer do now:

- Be eager to impress by taking on tight deadlines and then spent sleepless nights and weekends to accomplish it. Needless to say, it was not good for health. Trying to impress would prevent timely communication about progress concerns. And looking back, re-negotiating deadlines and resources when they looked infeasible might have been a better strategy. An individual contributor only has fixed amount of time. But a team's time is more elastic as it can shift people from one project to another, more urgent one. Thus, instead of doubling down, ask for help and more people. 

- Be possessive of the code. Software engineers write code based on their mental concept of how a system would work and interact. Given the same business requirements, individuals have different way of structuring their code. One may prefer having a large centralized logic unit while other spreading logic into smaller more specialized unit. No matter what amount of best practices would change that. After leading software teams, I've come to accept those idiosynchrasies, and to trust teammates to do what reasonable. In the end, performance metrics and business metrics will drive system designs. 

- Be too quick to do stuff. 

Other thing I learnt about the industry and my preference working in it:
- Come to term with the fact that most software code would be replaced. (thrown away). Cite the Google software design concept paper here.

Book wise. 

Relationship wise
