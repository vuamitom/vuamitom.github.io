A decade time would feel short when the clock was ticking pass midnight on the last day of 2019. Where all the time has gone. Yet, a simple act of comparison between the self now and a decade ago, that whole decade would start to appear more real, heavier and thicker in one's awareness. Old perceptions, preferences, fears, worries, desires were replaced by the new. Changes happened slow enough that one hardly noticed, yet, significant enough to surprise us when compressed in a moment of reminiscing. This is my first time to write them down.

Career wise, I earned my bachelor degree, got my first job and worked in 5 different cities. A few things that I used to do when I first started to work but no longer do now:

- Be eager to impress by taking on tight deadlines and then spent sleepless nights and weekends to accomplish it. Needless to say, it was not good for health. Trying to impress would prevent timely communication about progress concerns. And looking back, re-negotiating deadlines and resources when they looked infeasible might have been a better strategy. An individual contributor only has fixed amount of time. But a team's time is more elastic as it can shift people from one project to another, more urgent one. Thus, instead of doubling down, ask for help and more people. 

- Be possessive of the code. Software engineers write code based on their mental concept of how a system would work and interact. Given the same business requirements, individuals have different way of structuring their code. One may prefer having a large centralized logic unit while other spreading logic into smaller more specialized unit. No matter what amount of best practices would change that. After leading software teams, I've come to accept those idiosynchrasies, and to trust teammates to do what reasonable. In the end, performance metrics and business metrics will drive system designs. 

- Be reckless. In the beginning, putting a new programming language to test in the next project sounded like a nice thing. Now I would prefer to use a familiar toolset to solve real problem rather than getting to know a new ecosystem, unless there are compelling reasons to do so. And a decade ago, I would be eagerly jump on board a new app project, now I would be more likely to talk people out of it. 

- Think that some part of software is cooler that the other. Backend vs frontend, security vs application, consumer app vs enterprises. They require different skill sets. Thus different people with 

While learning about myself, I have also learnt more about the industry, which keeps changing every day and yet, something hardly change about its people.
- Come to term with the fact that most software code would be replaced. (thrown away). Cite the Google software design concept paper here. 
- cyclic: RDBMS vs no SQL. SOA and microservices. People dig up old terms. Give it a more trendy name. 
- name dropper. if you have a hammer. Everything looks like a nail. People are often loud about what technologies they think best. And it take energy and effort to pursuade them otherwise. 
- the argument 

Awareness of a more complicated landscape. Aware of my limited knowledge and yet, more confident. Accepting to be normal. Nervousness to get to know big name. Having worked in one. 

Book wise. 

Relationship wise
