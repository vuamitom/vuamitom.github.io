I don't remember when I first learnt about vectors. 
Maybe it was sometimes in sophomore years, when the Decart plane was introduced. 
A vector is a directed line between two points on the plane.

In linear algebra done right

- a vector space is a set of lists, functions or objects. 
- math operator like minus sign does not just exist, it is a notion we define. 
- vector space can be defined recursively. e.g Vs as a vector space over V, which is a vector space over F (either C or R)
