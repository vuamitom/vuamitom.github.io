Since when did I learn to be bored? Long ago, the same me would be pretty comfortable with being at home and let the day pass. Now a normal day with going to work and then back home would be labeled boring. It's like a constant craving for happenings, changes, events to fill my day. Take a step back and make peace with the reality that a big part of life would be in repetition and habitual. Little by little, every day. Things that are slow to change will be the anchor. The mind will adjust itself to the slow pace at which stimulus happen.
