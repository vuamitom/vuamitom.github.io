When I first started out my career as a software engineer, professionals working with multiple displays seemed cool and power packed. Such desk arrangement creates an impression of a lots of things going on. People would quickly move their gazes between one montior and another as open files scattered across screen. Perhaps that helped multi-tasking as you can code on one monitor and refer to documents on another. I used to do that too. But now I'm more comfortable using a single monitor. It helps with the neck since I don't have to turn around. And screen estate is small. That limitation forces me to close unnecessary stuff. Focus on one thing at a time.
