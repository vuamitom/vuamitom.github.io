In Kazuo Ishiguro's novels, sometimes there are looming inevitable waiting at the end. 
Like in Never Let Me Go, those children become donors and completes. 
Or in Klara and the Sun, child owners soon grow up and change, leaving robot servants behind. 
As these stories progress, we may hope for twists and turns that would resolve the tension and avoid sad endings. 
Yet none came, the tension defuses toward that inevitable. Just that instead of sadness or resentment, it is a sense of gentle acceptance. 
Kathy receives her first donation notice. And Klara finds herself in the junkyard. And life goes on.
