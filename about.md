I'm a software engineer. Systems with well orchestrated independent components fascinated me. I built a few fairly complex rich client applications. Doing better each day.

Long walks are among other things that I enjoy doing. Bustling streets of Southeast Asia cities or cherry blossom Tokyo's riverside are both my favorite places to stroll by.
